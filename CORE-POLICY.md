AtomixCore Open Source Software Contribution & Usage Policy

1. Policy Title and Purpose  
   1.1 Title  
     AtomixCore Open Source Software Contribution & Usage Policy  
   1.2 Purpose  
     This policy establishes the principles, guidelines and procedures by which AtomixCore (“the Organization”) manages, accepts and licenses contributions to its open source codebase. Our goal is to foster experimental, high-performance software while preserving creative vision, community trust and legal clarity.

2. Scope  
   2.1 Applicability  
     • All external and internal contributors to any AtomixCore repository under the MIT license.  
     • Maintainers, reviewers and automation systems operating on behalf of AtomixCore.  
     • Downstream users, forks and redistributors of AtomixCore projects.  
   2.2 Exclusions  
     • Proprietary add-ons not explicitly released under the MIT license.  
     • Private, internal forks that do not interact with the public codebase.

3. Definitions  
   3.1 “MIT License”  
     A permissive, open source license granting free use, modification and distribution with minimal obligations.  
   3.2 “Contribution”  
     Any code, documentation, design asset or configuration submitted via Pull Request (PR) or Issue.  
   3.3 “Purposeful vs. Cosmetic Change”  
     Purposeful: adds functionality, fixes bugs, enhances performance.  
     Cosmetic: superficial edits (typos, formatting) that do not materially improve the project.  
   3.4 “Fork”  
     A copy of the repository where development diverges independently while preserving original attribution.  
   3.5 “Surveillance-Oriented Tools”  
     Software that monitors, logs or spies on users without explicit, informed consent.  
   3.6 “Corporatization”  
     Attempts to over-sanitize, rebrand or impose restrictive commercial controls contrary to the project’s ethos.

4. Policy Guidelines and Requirements  
   4.1 Licensing  
     • All AtomixCore projects are released under the MIT license.  
     • Contributors must sign or agree to the Organization’s Contributor License Agreement (CLA) where requested.  
   4.2 Contribution Principles  
     • Purposeful contributions only. Submissions that do not add measurable value may be closed without review.  
     • Encourage novel, experimental and high-performance code.  
     • Maintain clarity, minimalism and an attitude of “brilliant madness.”  
   4.3 Code Quality Standards  
     • Automated tests and benchmarks are highly encouraged, especially for performance-critical paths.  
     • Avoid bloated dependencies and heavyweight frameworks; prefer lean, composable libraries.  
   4.4 Forking  
     • Forks are welcome. The original credit, license headers and README must remain intact.  
     • Clearly document divergences in a “FORKED-FROM” notice.  
   4.5 Communication & Submission  
     • No templates required—raw, direct communication is preferred.  
     • Use clear commit messages; reference issue numbers where appropriate.  
     • Label PRs with meaningful titles (e.g., “feature: async scheduler”, not “update code”).  
   4.6 Prohibited Content  
     • Spyware, malware or any code intended for unauthorized surveillance.  
     • Vendor lock-in mechanisms or closed-source submodules.  
   4.7 Anti-Corporatization  
     • Any attempt to sanitize, rebrand or commercialize the codebase against community norms will be rejected.  
     • Community-driven governance prevails over corporate edicts.

5. Procedures and Processes  
   5.1 Contribution Workflow  
     1. Fork the repository.  
     2. Create a feature branch with a descriptive name.  
     3. Implement changes; include tests/benchmarks as needed.  
     4. Commit with clear messages; push to your fork.  
     5. Open a PR against AtomixCore’s main branch.  
     6. Engage in reviewer feedback; iterate as necessary.  
   5.2 Forking Process  
     • Preserve LICENSE and README files.  
     • Add a NOTICE or HISTORY file noting the origin and your changes.  
   5.3 Issue Reporting  
     • Open issues with concise titles and a brief description of problem or proposal.  
     • Attach minimal repro case or performance data when relevant.  
   5.4 Review & Approval  
     • Maintainers will triage within 7 business days.  
     • High-performance changes may require benchmark results.  
     • Final approval requires at least one maintainer sign-off; critical changes may need two.  
   5.5 License Compliance  
     • Automated scans will verify that all source files contain proper MIT headers.  
     • Contributors must certify third-party dependencies are compatible with MIT.

6. Compliance and Consequences  
   6.1 Compliance Monitoring  
     • Automated CI checks (lint, tests, license headers)  
     • Periodic manual audits for prohibited content  
   6.2 Non-Compliance  
     • Immediate PR/commit rejection and request for remediation.  
     • Repeated offenses may lead to contributor access suspension.  
     • In severe cases (malicious code, spyware) public notice of violation and removal of offending code.

7. Disclaimers and Legal Considerations  
   • All software is provided “AS IS,” without warranty of any kind.  
   • AtomixCore disclaims liability for damages arising from use or inability to use the software.  
   • Contributors affirm that their submissions are original or properly licensed for inclusion under MIT.  
   • This policy does not constitute legal advice. Consult qualified counsel for specific obligations.

8. Company Culture Reflection  
   • Tagline: “Where brilliant madness meets elegant code.”  
   • We operate fully remote/distributed—expect asynchronous, candid interactions.  
   • Founded in 2025 to push developer tooling into uncharted territory.  
   • Our community thrives on experimentation, speed and uncompromising code elegance.

9. Approval, Effective Date and Revision History
