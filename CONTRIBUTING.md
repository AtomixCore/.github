# 🤝 How to Contribute to AtomixCore

Welcome, chaos-coder. Here's how to get started:

1. Fork the repo you’re targeting.
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-idea`
3. Commit clearly. Use tags like `fix:`, `feature:`, `perf:`
4. Open a Pull Request with a short title and a raw description.
5. No need to be fancy. We prefer directness over formality.

🔒 No surveillance tools. No closed-source bloat.  
🔁 Forks must keep LICENSE & README intact.  
💥 Code should punch above its size — we love clever hacks.

Need help? Open an issue or shout into the void. We’re probably listening.
